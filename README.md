UbiPong Tester
==============

For the tests to work, the API service must be running.

Edit `spec/config/environment.js` to set the API host.

Run

```
npm test
```

Reporting
---------

Settings are found in `spec/helpers/reports.js`.
For VS Code, `terminalReporter` is not needed.  Use a `jasmine runner` instead.
