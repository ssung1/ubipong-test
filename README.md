UbiPong Tester
==============

Part of <https://github.com/ssung1/ubipong-ecosystem>.  It is easier
to run the test from there.

See `spec/config/environment.js` to see which environment variables are 
required.

Run

```
npm test
```

Reporting
---------

Settings are found in `spec/helpers/reports.js`.
For VS Code, `terminalReporter` is not needed.  Use a `jasmine runner` instead.
